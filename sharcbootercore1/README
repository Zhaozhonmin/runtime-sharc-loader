EE-399 Overview of the Linux Runtime SHARC+ Loader on ADSP-SC58x Processors

Loader Stub for Sharc core 1

This Sharc application performs a "memory boot" from a memory buffer.  It uses the boot kernel
API to boot from run-time.  It supplies and registers a "Load" function for this "memory boot".
Since this application is meant to work in conjunction with a Linux application, loadSharc, the "Load" 
function communicates with loadSharc to request boot stream data and wait for it.

This has been developed and verified on:

CCES 2.3.0 on an ADSP-SC589 EZ-BOARD 1.1 (0.1 silicon)
